					<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p>The current Internet is built on protocols that were designed nearly 40 years ago and require a hierarchical network with centralized control in order to scale. Technology has progressed exponentially in that time, but the original protocols remain and have not easily adapted to the complexity of today&#8217;s networks. <a href="https://projectmeshnet.org/">Project Meshnet</a> is a clean slate that uses modern technology and ideas to address these shortcomings. Its goal is the creation of a <em>decentralized</em> global network with security, simplicity, and scalability built in from the start.</p>

          <p>Powered by <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns">cjdns</a>, we already have thousands of nodes running all types of services, but most of these nodes are connected to each other by peering over the regular Internet. We&#8217;d like to change that&#8230;</p>

					<div class="panel">
						<p>Spokane Meshnet is a community of people in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Northwest_%28United_States%29">Inland Northwest</a> interested in establishing and maintaining the <em>physical infrastructure</em> to support Project Meshnet&#8217;s goals. Combined with other existing &#8220;mesh locals&#8221;, the Spokane Meshnet embodies this new global network (referred to as &#8220;<a href="http://hyperboria.net/">Hyperboria</a>&#8221;) that is inherently resistant to censorship, surveillance, and disruption. We&#8217;re creating change by creating technology.</p>
					</div>

					<h2 id="why">Why Should You Care?</h2>

					<p>Do you care about <strong>privacy</strong> and upholding civil liberties in a time when it&#8217;s increasingly difficult to maintain the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of your data online?</p>

					<p>Do you desire a <strong>resilient network</strong> that can stay up even during a natural disaster, local emergency, or (more likely) a construction crew accidentally cutting through a fiber line?</p>

					<p>Are you a <strong>technology enthusiast</strong> who enjoys developing/testing innovative software and tinkering with network equipment?</p>

					<p>Do you believe that <strong>people should be able to speak out</strong> against oppressive regimes, the press should be able to report the truth, and whistleblowers should have a means to expose corruption?</p>

					<p>Or are you simply <strong>tired of paying</strong> your <acronym title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</acronym> exorbitant amounts money for substandard service?</p>

					<p>In all of these cases, Project Meshnet has something to offer you! Much like the Internet circa 1994, we&#8217;re a small but helpful community with massive potential. Come and join us.</p>

					<h2 id="involved">Get Involved</h2>

					<p>Spokane Meshnet needs your help.
