        <h2>Mesh 101: The Fundamentals</h2>

        <h3>What is a Mesh Network?</h3>
        <p>
          Think of a <strong>mesh network</strong> like a neighborhood where
          everyone helps deliver the mail. Instead of relying on a central post
          office, each device (like a house) talks <em>directly</em> to its
          neighbors and passes messages along, one hop at a time, until they
          reach their destination.
        </p>
        <p>That means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>No single point of failure.</strong> If one device goes
            offline, the network finds another way to deliver the message. This
            is called <em>self-healing</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stronger with every node.</strong> Each new device expands
            coverage and reliability by adding more range and alternate paths.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Grows with your group.</strong> Whether it's five hikers on
            a trail or fifty people across a city, the network is
            <em>self-organizing</em>. It will automatically find the best paths
            and scale up as more devices join.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is MeshCore?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>MeshCore</strong> is the open-source software that powers the
          backbone of our mesh network. It uses <em>LoRa</em>, a wireless
          technology designed for long-range, low-power communication over
          unlicensed frequencies in the radio spectrum.

                  No license is needed. Unlike ham radio, which needs an FCC
                  amateur radio license, MeshCore runs on
                  <strong>unlicensed ISM bands</strong> (typically 915 MHz in
                  North America) that are legal for anyone to use.

                  Look for high spots with a clear view to other nodes and
                  strong southern sun exposure if off-grid. Even small changes
                  in placement can make a big difference. As they say,

              🙈 &nbsp; What's the difference between MeshCore and
              Meshtastic&reg;?
              <span class="accordion-icon"></span>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <div class="accordion-content-inner">
                <p>
                  MeshCore (launched January 2025) is a fresh take on mesh
                  networks, built on years of lessons learned from earlier
                  systems like Meshtastic&reg;. It emphasizes simplicity,
                  scalability, and reliable message delivery. With just a small
                  set of device roles, it's hard to misconfigure, and the
                  defaults (including a 64-hop limit and minimal flood
                  broadcasts) are tuned to keep messages flowing smoothly
                  without clogging the airwaves.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Meshtastic&reg; (started in 2020) helped pioneer open LoRa
                  mesh networking, and still shines in areas such as sensor
                  metrics and ATAK integration. But its more complex role system
                  with 12 options and a default hop limit of just three can make
                  scaling more difficult and setup more error-prone. While
                  recent updates have improved direct message routing behavior,
                  long-standing design decisions can make broad improvements
                  harder to roll out. MeshCore, by contrast, benefits from a
                  clean slate and delivers more flexibility, usability, and
                  efficiency out of the box.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Beyond the tech, the MeshCore community is fast-moving,
                  collaborative, and welcoming. Development is open, feedback is
                  valued, and new features are introduced thoughtfully to
                  protect network performance. If you're looking for a modern
                  mesh that works at scale, MeshCore is well worth a try.
